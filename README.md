Its design incorporates many contemporary theories about layouts to find a balance between comfort and speed. In addition to its impressive performance in metrics, Graphite has also been extensively tested and validated through real-world usage."

# Installation
## Startup
The layout for user sessions can be installed by running  
`sudo sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dracape/graphene/main/install.sh)"`
Keep in mind that this script only provides the bare minimum configuration to get the layout working in the user session; it is not sufficient for a full installation.
This script installs the layout as a US keymap variant—making an entry only in `/usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/evdev.xml`.

It's just so that you can get your hands working

## Further setup
**1**. Make entries for the other files  
> [!TIP]
> at ``/usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/``

**2**. set the layout as default for outside user sessions (such as a *display manager*)
> [!TIP]
> use `localectl`
  
**3**. Set the layout as the default for any new users created (optional)
> [!TIP]
> in `/etc/default/keyboard`

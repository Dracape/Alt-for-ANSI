## Initial

## Further
##### Set the layout as the default for any new users created (optional)
Edit `/etc/default/keyboard`
> [!TIP]
> Set the `XKBVARIANT` value
> - `graphene`
> - `midnight`

[^unpreserved-layer-keys/weird-layer-distro]: This layout treats *Shift* and *AltGr* as modifiers that are assigned to a thumb on each hand instead of layer switchers; Sometimes some keys are at unconfortable positions and thus, don't have a third key assigned to them.  
  In a typical layout, the 2nd keys would go to the 2nd layer; while in *Graphene*, if they are in the left side, they are put in the *Symbol* layer so that the alternate hand can be used so press it (for ergonomics)
